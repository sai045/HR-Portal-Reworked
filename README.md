# HR-Portal-Reworked

This is a rework of a project I built in 2022 using MERN stack and deployed on vercel and render. <br />
We are focusing on optimizing the following task <br />
1. Using the new hooks and making the styling light weight so that the frontend using ReactJS is optimized.
2. Using MongoDB local instead on cloud so that we can scale the database how we see best.
3. Removing the unnecessary APIs that are being deployed on the backend and make private raoutes that require authorizaion thus increasing the security of our backend.
4. Writing software test cases to for quality assurance.
5. Deploy the application on AWS using Docker, Kubernetes and Jenkins for Scalability of the application.
